## 🎯 What This Does

AI Asset Price Predictor is a professional trading assistant that uses machine learning to forecast prices of stocks and cryptocurrencies. It combines:

- **🤖 AI Predictions** - XGBoost model forecasts 7-day prices
- **📊 Technical Analysis** - 25+ indicators including RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- **🎯 Trading Signals** - BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations with confidence levels
- **🛡️ Risk Management** - Complete trading plans with stop-loss & take-profit
- **📈 Real-time Data** - Multiple API sources with automatic fallback

## ⚙️ How It Works

#### 1. The Core Objective
The application is designed for **high availability**. In financial applications, external APIs are notoriously unreliable due to rate limits or downtime. This system is "resilient" by design; if real-time data fetching fails, it automatically triggers a **Synthetic Data Engine** to generate realistic market movements based on historical volatility, ensuring the platform never crashes and remains fully testable.

#### 2. Technical Architecture

* **The Data Fetcher (`RealDataFetcher`)**
    Think of this as the "Librarian" of the system. It manages data through a three-tier priority system:
    1.  **Local Cache:** Checks for existing `.parquet` or `.csv` files to minimize API calls and latency.
    2.  **Real-Time APIs:** Authenticates with professional providers (Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data) using secure API keys.
    3.  **Synthetic Engine:** A mathematical fallback that generates price history if keys are missing or limits are reached.
    4.  **Windows-Safe File Handling:** Implements specialized permission handling (`os.chmod`) to prevent "File in Use" errors common on Windows environments during cache clearing.



* **The AI Engine (`AITraderEngine`)**
    This is the "Brain" that processes raw data into actionable intelligence:
    * **Feature Engineering:** Calculates 25+ technical indicators, including **RSI** (momentum), **Moving Averages** (trend), and **MACD** (trend shifts).
    * **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes the **XGBoost** machine learning algorithm combined with polynomial trend extrapolation to forecast prices for a 7 to 30-day window.
    * **Signal Generation:** Maps mathematical outputs to human-readable signals like `🟢 STRONG BUY`, `🔴 SELL`, or `⚪ HOLD`.

* **The Dashboard (UI Layer)**
    Built with **Streamlit**, the dashboard provides a professional-grade interface:
    * **Sidebar:** Real-time configuration of symbols, forecast horizons, and live API key updates without app restarts.
    * **Main Console:** High-density "Metric Cards" and interactive **Plotly** charts (Candlesticks, Volume, and Momentum oscillators).



#### 3. Key Engineering Features

| Feature | Technical Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **API Key Hot-Swapping** | JSON-based persistence allows keys to take effect immediately in the session state. |
| **Intelligent Risk Scoring** | A custom algorithm that calculates a 0–100 risk score based on volatility and RSI extremes. |
| **Interactive Visuals** | Multi-pane Plotly subplots that mimic professional terminals (Bloomberg/TradingView style). |
| **State Management** | Uses `lru_cache` to optimize performance and prevent redundant heavy computations. |
